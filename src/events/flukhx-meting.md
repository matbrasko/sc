## 8 HOURS OF LIVING CULTURE

_by Frontløberne, UKH and Institut for (X) feat. VVE_

_On August 11th the three cultural platforms do a takeover at Avenue One in Ridehuset. The takeover will happen in two stages:_

- 🎆 _MASH-UP_ - outside at Officerspladsen (approx. 15:00-19:00)
  Throughout the day, we stage cool cultural creators and projects in abundance. Expect everything from upcycling workshops to live art and literature as well as live podcasts. A marketplace of living culture. 🎨
- 🔮 _MEETING_ - inside of Ridehuset (approx. 19:00-22:00)
  In the evening we will facilitate an alternative and artistic dialogue across the cultural field - from youth cultural to institutional and political agents. This is the first of many attempts to connect the cultural field of Aarhus. Please do attend - to make your voice heard or just to listen. ✌️

Throughout the day and evening, different DJ's and actors will provide the soundscape of the day. The DJ collective VVE will provide the vibes in the evening. Many more will contribute along the way.

_PROGRAM for the Mash-Up (15-19) - workshops, artists etc. Look forward to meeting:_

- 💔 _The Heartbreak Collection_ - an interactive art installation that collects, shares and exhibits stories of broken hearts
- 💫 _Club Curious_ - the creative collective are hosting their very own Tattoo Salon using stencils, body paint, glitter etc.
- 🎧 _Live Podcasting_ - meet awesome podcasters TBA
- 🌱 _Navus_ - the brand new sustainability and event organizers Navus are gonna surprise you with thought-provoking and co-creational sculpturing onsite.
- 🏀 _Siamo Street_ - to keep the pulse and playfulness high, Siamo Street are gonna provide competitions and games throughout the day.
