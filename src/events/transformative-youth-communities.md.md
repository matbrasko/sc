## HOW DO WE CHANGE OUR CITY THROUGH MEANINGFUL COMMUNITIES?

_Along with Kulturmødet Mors, we created a policy lab about youth communities. The questions confronted: How to organize to make a change? What is the status of the communities post-corona? And, going forward, how can we promote the power of youths coming together for a course?_

The event was a hybrid. First part was a national, digital debate with participants from the whole country: Shubhdeep Singh Parwana (soulitate chaibar), Rikke Bogetoft (Unges møde med kunsten/Undergrowth Events), Magnus Mosholm (Subhuset/KRAS), Malte Houe (Ung Kult) and Laura Spanggaard Bülow (Rampen). The second part was a physical event at Frontløberne – including panel talk, dinner, live podcasting and intimate concert.

_The programme:_
1. Digital debate
2. Dinner - feat. SensEAT
3. Panel talk – feat. Nicoline Quarrie (Cypher Movement), Anne Eggebrecht (SKATEDUCATE) and Camilla Aneto (det turkise telt)
