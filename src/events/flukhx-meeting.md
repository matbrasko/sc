## THE GROWTH LAYER CULTURE OF AARHUS

_ In the grand and historic setting of Ridehuset, the FLUKHX Meeting brougt together youth cultural agents, municipal art centres and politicians of Aarhus. In this meeting, together we confronted questions such as: What do we meen when we talk about growth layer culture (vækstlag)? Who has access to it? Where is it going? And how do we together qualify and strengthen the unique, cultural communities of Aarhus?_

The conversation was moderated by Astrid and Peter from Urban Goods and it unfolded in three stages:
_1. Culture and accessibility:_ How do we create a coherent city of culture that encourages and enables everyone to engage?
_2. Mapping the cultural landscape of Aarhus:_ Where do we go and how do we connect?
_3. The cross-disciplinary:_ Entrepreneurship and growth layer culture. How do we create a sustainable cultural environment?

All of this was framed by artistic intermezzos from the viola player Kirsten Buus Szakacs as well as the choir Clemens Knejterne.

_Heat 1: Culture and accessibility_
Jesper Mardahl from PROMUS, Daniel Aneto from 8000 Stories and André Thelin from SKATEDUCATE contributed amongst others. Some of the main take-outs were that we are already working on a better integration between growth layer agents and the municipal centres as well as settled culture institutions. This important work has to elevated and highlighted even better in order to ensure accessibility for cultural agents on all levels. We also face a big challenge in terms of bridging the big cultural gap between central Aarhus and the surrounding parts of the city.

_Heat 2: Mapping the cultural landscape of Aarhus_
In this session, the gathering interacted with a big map of Aarhus. People were incouraged to mark where in the city they feel inspired, challenged, entertained and so on. This led to workshops and conversations about specific parts of the city such as Riis Skov, Aarhus K, Aarhus Ø and Sydhavnen. See the map in the photos.

_Heat 3: The cross-disciplinary_
Laura Ellen Charlotte Carlsen from Aarhus Volume, Ole Jørgensen from ARoS Public, Camilla Aneto from det turkise telt, Beatriz Gonzalez Rodriguez from UAC Art Platform, Raffael Bender and Jesper Kjeldsen from Socialdemokratiet contributed amongst others. The discussion was centered around the struggles of breaking through the glass roof of the culture business. It is a hard game to be in – and people have to be willing to fail and invest everything to get through the eye of the needle. Both monitary, cultural as well as social capital is invested as an up-and-coming cultural entrepreneur. We talked about how cross-disciplinary and sectoral cooperation can open new possibilities, we talked about the obligations and abilities of the big cultural institutions of Aarhus to nourish growth layer agents, and finally we talked about the prioritization of the municipal culture budget (do too much money end up in too few institutions?).
