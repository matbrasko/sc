          <p>
            Approaching the local elections in November 2021, Sweet City is a
            project that facilitates dialogue and amplifies the dreams and
            criticisms of the Aarhusian youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Aarhus, more than 45% of the population are under 30 years old.
            Aarhus is the most youthful city in Denmark. And yet, too many young
            people don’t feel heard and prioritized in the city development and
            the political debate. We are here to change that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only by engaging, you can make a change. There are many ways to
            shape a better world and in Sweet City we do it by engaging in the
            political debate, by creating new political foras and by talking in
            new ways.
